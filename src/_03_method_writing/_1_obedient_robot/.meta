  ## Goal:


  Make an obedient robot that will obey commands to draw shapes.


  ## Steps:


  1. This recipe practices writing and calling void methods.

  2. Make a new class, create a main method, and show the robot.

  3. Have the robot draw a square.

  4. Put this code into a drawSquare() method.

  5. Have the robot draw a triangle.

  6. Put this code into a drawTriangle() method.

  7. Have the robot draw a circle.

  8. Put this code into a drawCircle() method.

  9. Ask the user which shape they want. Draw the appropriate shape depending on their
  answer (call the right method).

  10. Ask the user which color they want. Give them some choices so you don''t have
  to accomodate every possible color. Color the the shape depending on their answer.
