###

Variables
‘Declare and initialize a variable’ means make a variable and give it a value.
int age = 12;
String name = “Sarah”;
Remember, String is capitalized and the value always has quotes around it.
Every time you want to hold a new piece of information you need to declare the variable and initialize it, by setting it equal to something.
If you want to generate a random number you do it like this.
int x = new Random().nextInt(10);
The number in parenthesis limits the value of the random number you will get. In this case, x will be a number between 0 and 9.

###

if Statements
if (condition){

}
else if (next condition){

}
else{

}
The question looks like this for a String
(name .equals (“Sarah”))
You use .equals to compare a String. The String value is in parenthesis and in quotes.
The question looks like this for an int
(age == 12)
Remember you use == for a comparison.
It is a good idea to use an else with an if statement to catch any options you didn’t think of.

###

for loop
for ( int i = 0; i<10; i++){

}
<font color="green">
int i = 0;
</font>
This is the starting point of the loop. You must declare the int.
<font color="green">
i<10;
</font>
This is the finishing point for the loop. The loop will continue as long as i is less than 10.
i++ This is how much the loop counter changes by each time. In this case it increments (goes up) by 1.
for ( int i = 10; i>0; i-=2){

}
This loop counts down in 2s starting at 10.
10, 8 , 6, 4, 2.  It doesn’t go to 0 because it must be greater than 0.
Notice that you have to change from less than (<) to greater than (>) when you count down.

###

JOptionPane
If you want a pop up to give the user a message use
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, “Hello ”+ name);
Don’t forget the
<b>
null
</b>
, or that any text needs to be in quotes.
If you want to get an answer from the user, use:
String ageString = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(“How old are you?”);
Remember you must catch the user’s answer in a String, otherwise you can’t use it.
Because the answer is always a String, you sometimes want to convert it to a number so you can do a calculation. This is how you do it.
int age = Integer.parseInt(ageString);
If you want to write something to the console, instead of using a pop-up
System.out.println(age);

### Methods

You must have a
<b>
main method
</b>
in order to start your class running.
public static void main(String[] args){

}
Other methods looks like this
void drawSquare(){
for (int i= 0; i<4; i++){
Tortoise.move(100);
Tortoise.turn(90);
}
}
<font color="green">
void
</font>
This tells you what the method will return - in this case nothing.
<font color="green">
drawSquare
</font>
This is the name of the method, that you use to call it.
<font color="green">
(  )
</font>
This tells you what parameters the method needs. In this case it doesn’t need any.
You call the method like this:
drawSquare();
Look at this method:
int sevenTimes(int number){
return number * 7;
}
<font color="green">
int
</font>
This method is going to a return an int so you need to create an int variable to store it. In the example below, the variable is named "answer".
<font color="green">
sevenTimes
</font>
This is the name of the method, that you use when you call it.
<font color="green">
(int number)
</font>
This tells you what parameters the method needs. In this case it needs you to give an int. In the example below, the int is the number 2.
int answer = sevenTimes(2);
The value of answer will be 14.

###

Modulo

Modulo means remainder.
The value of 11%5 is 1, because 5 goes into 11, 2 times (5x2=10) with a remainder of 1.

It is useful to use modulo to alternate between options. e.g.

for (int i = 0; i<1000;i+=10){
if (i%3==0){
fill(255,0,0);
}
else if (i%3==1){
fill(0,255,0);
}
else if (i%3==2){
fill(0,0,255);
}
ellipse(i,i,10,10);
}

This code will draw a line of circles alternating in red, green and blue.
