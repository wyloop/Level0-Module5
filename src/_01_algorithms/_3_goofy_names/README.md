# Goofy Names

<hr/>
GoOfY NaMeS

## Goal:

Write an algorithm to change a String into a "goofy" version.

## Steps:

1. Ask the user to enter their name.
2. Use a loop to alternately modify each character of the name into uppercase and lowercase letters until a new "goofy" representation of their name has been constructed.

For example, if they enter their name as Alexander Hamilton

their goofy name will be AlExAnDeR HaMiLtOn
3. Show the user the goofy version of their name in a pop-up.
