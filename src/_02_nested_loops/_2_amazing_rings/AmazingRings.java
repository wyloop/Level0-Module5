/*
 * Goal: Create a pair of Amazing Rings!
 * 
 * 1. Open the demonstration for this recipe by opening the Recipe.html
 *    file in this folder.
 * 
 * In the setup() method:
 * 2. Set the size of your window to be a rectangle like in the recipe
 *    demonstration
 * 3. Call the noFill() command so all the ellipses will be transparent
 *
 * In the draw() method:
 * 4. Use a for loop to make the first set of rings that will start in the
 *    left half of the window (you can use your code from Bullseye).
 * 
 * 5. Make this set of rings move across the sketch to the right
 *    Hint: make two variables, one for x and another for the speed.
 *    Then increase x by the amount in speed.
 *
 * 6. When the rings reach the right side of the sketch, reverse the direction
 *    so they move
 *    Hint: speed = -speed
      
 * 7. When the rings reach the left side of the sketch, reverse the direction
 *    again.
 * 
 * CHALLENGE - to finish the Amazing Rings
 * 8. Add another for loop to draw the second set of rings that will start in
 *    the right half of the window
 *
 * 9. Make this set of rings move in the opposite direction to the other rings
 *    These rings must also "bounce" off the sides of the window.
